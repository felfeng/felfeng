I am a Computer Science student at UC Davis passionate about product management, software engineering, and building user-centric products. I thrive in fast-paced environments, love out-of-the-box problem-solving, and enjoy exploring the intersection of tech, design, and business.  
🫐 My project ideas spring from an inherent love for art and the creatives.
